Bungee Problem:

The function is

   hmin = H - 2Mg/ k sigma

where H is the distance of the jumping platform to the ground
      M is the mass (kg)
      sigma is the number of strands in the cord
      g is gravity (9.8m/s2)
      k is the elastic constrant of one strand (N/m) = 1.5

H is uniformly distributed [40,60]
M = U(67 kg, 74 kg)
sigma = U(20,40)

99.99% for 4 standard deviations
 
sensitivity indices
H ~0.45
M ~0.01
sig ~0.54

===============================================
To run:

cd to this directory
cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in

(1) to perform uncertainty analysis

    - rename psuadeData to psSave
    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > ana_expert  <turn on expert mode for graphics>
      > ua (or ca)
      

(2) to perform main effect analysis

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rssobol1

(3) to perform 2-way interaction analysis

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rssobol2

(4) to perform total order analysis

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rssoboltsi

(5) to generate plots

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > <use rs1, rs2, or rs3 for response surfaces, or 
         iplot1, iplot2 .. for scatter plots>

===============================================
To experiment with user regression:

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in
mv psuadeData psd

psuade
> load psd
> rscheck
  choose user regression

  enter number of terms = 10 (see user_regression.py file)
  enter executable = user_regression.py

for codegen: edit the user function 
===============================================
To experiment with selective regression:
cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in
mv psuadeData psd

psuade
> load psd
> rscheck
  choose selective regression
  (selective_regression_file will be detected automatically

===============================================
To experiment with Legendre regression:
cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in

psuade
> load psd
> rscheck
  choose Legendre regression
  enter order

===============================================
To experiment with GradLegendre regression:
cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeDeriv.in
mv psuadeData psd

psuade
> load psd
> odelete (then choose output 1 to delete)
> write deriv
> load psd
> rscheck
  choose gradLegendre
  enter deriv as derivative file
