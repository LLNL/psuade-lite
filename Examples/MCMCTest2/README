Problem: a simulation model with multimodal posteriors

There are two functions so there are two outputs: (see simulator.c)

The experimental data are generated by experiment.c.
- Experimental condition for X1 is fixed at 0.4 (fixed parameter)
- Experimental conditions for X4 are 0.2,0.4, 0.6, ... 1.8
  So X4 is a design parameter 
- X2 and X3 are set to 0.3 and 1.7, respectively
- The function is prescribed such that X2 and X3 are interchangeable,
  so X2 and X3 can also be 1.7 and 0.3 respectively
- Experimental data sets are created by running experiment.c
  which gives the 'expdata' file.
  * (9 2 1 4) means 9 experiments, 2 outputs, 1 design variable (param 4)
  * line 3 : experimetn 1, X4=0.2, output 1 mean, output 1 std dev, ... 
PSUADE_BEGIN
 9 2 1 4
1 0.2   6.018e+01   6.018e-01   6.856e+01   6.856e-01
...
PSUADE_END

==============================================
How to set up the test?

- first create 'expdata' by compiling experiment.c and running it
- now we need to fix X1 to 0.4 and this is achieved by
  * in psuadeRS.in file, set up the rs index file (see psuadeRS.in)
  * create a 'indexFile' to tell PSUADE that X1 is fixed and is =0.4
- compile simulator.c to become simulator executable
  (cc -c simulator simulator.c -lm)

==============================================
How to run the test?
- first create a sample by running: psuade psuadeRS.in
- rename psuadeData to, say, simdata: mv psuadeData simdata
- launch psuade in command line mode and run mcmc
  psuade
  > load simdata
  > rsmcmc
  ...
  enter 'expdata' when prompted for experimental data set
  > quit
- Use matlab to view matlabmcmc2.m

==============================================
The steps have been captured by psScript.in

just run: psuade < psScript.in
