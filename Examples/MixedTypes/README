This example demonstrates how to perform mixed aleatory-epistemic
uncertainty.

=================================================================

Bungee Problem:

The function is

   hmin = H - 2Mg/ k sigma

where H is the distance of the jumping platform to the ground
      M is the mass (kg)
      sigma is the number of strands in the cord
      g is gravity (9.8m/s2)
      k is the elastic constrant of one strand (N/m) = 1.5

H is uniformly distributed [40,60]
M = U(67 kg, 74 kg)
sigma = U(20,40)

99.99% for 4 standard deviations
 
sensitivity indices
H ~0.45
M ~0.01
sig ~0.54

=================================================================
1. generate and run a sample

   cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
   psuade psuade.in
   mv psuadeData psd

   Now 'psd' contains the sample and the sample outputs

2. Incorporate aleatory uncertainties

   set variable 1 to a Gaussian distribution (50, 2)
   set variable 2 to a Gaussian distribution (70.5, 0.7)
   Insert these statements in the INPUT section of 'psd'
        PDF 1 N 50 2
        PDF 2 N 70.5 0.7

3. perform analysis

   psuade
   > load psd
   > ae_ua
   > quit

   At the end, a file is created 'matlabaeua.m'.
