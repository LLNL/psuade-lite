User regression

Suppose simulator.c has the true function Y = 3 * X1 * X1 + 5 * X2 * X2
user.py has the basis functions X1*X1, X2*X2 and X1*X2 but no coefficients.

PSUADE can recover these coefficients given a sample set generated by
  the true function in simulator.c

Steps:

1. cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm

2. psuade psuade.in

3. mv psuadeData psdata

5. make sure user.py is executable (file permissions)
4. Launch psuade

psuade
> load psdata
> rscheck
  <choose 16>
  1                    <output 1>
  3                    <3 basis functions>
  user.py              <user-specified basis functions>
  n                    <no auxiliary arguments>
  <now examine the basis function coefficients on the screen>
  <They should be 3 and 5 - check with simulator.c>
  <You can continue to do cross validation>
