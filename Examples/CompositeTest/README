Two level UQ/SA:

Problem has two parameters and the model is in simulator.c

Initial ranges for the two inputs are [0.4, 0.6]

expdata2: contains data to calibrate X_2

simulator2.c and psuade2.in are used for generating a sample 
for X_2 for use in creating a response surface for MCMC.


===============================================
To run:
                                                                                
(1) cc -o simulator2 simulator2.c -lm

(2) psuade psuade2.in
    and then rename psuadeData to psData2

(3) run psuade with rsmcmc and ana_expert mode on
    When it is done, a MCMCPostSample is generated.

(4) read in MCMCPostSample using iread and then
    write it to a file called 'sample2'

(5) generate a sample for input 1 by running
    psuade psuade1.in. Then mv psuadeData to sample1.
  
(6) launch psuade and run rand_draw2 to generate
    a two-input sample. Write it to 'newSample'.

(7) cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm

(8) Set the driver in 'newSample' to 'simulator' 
    (Alternatively, run a small sample on 'simulator' and
     use that sample with response surface in replace of 
     'simulator')

(9) psuade newSample, then rename psuadeData to psData

(10) psuade
     > load psData
     > ua
     > me
