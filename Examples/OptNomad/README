Test problem #1 (Asaadi 1)

From: Sven Leyffer: 
"Deterministic Methods for Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming"

How to run:
- compile: cc -o simulator1 simulator1.c -lm
- psuade psuadeNomad1.in 
  and select variable types according to cases below

Case 1: input 1, 2, 4 are integers, input 3 is continuous

   Solution: min=-40.957, X=(0, 1, 2.236, 0)

Case 2: all 4 inputs are integers

   Solution: min=-38.0, X=(0, 1, 2, 0)

Case 3: all inputs are continuous

   Solution: min=-40.96, X=(0, 1.07, 2.22, 0)
   Cobyla is better.
   - Use: psuade psuadeCobyla1.in

Test problem #2 (Asaadi 2)

From: Sven Leyffer: 
"Deterministic Methods for Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming"

Case 1a: first 4 inputs integers, 3 continuous

How to run:
- compile: cc -o simulator2 simulator2.c -lm
- psuade psuadeNomad2ouu.in (enter M1=7)
  (also make sure the psuadeNomad2ouu.in file has discrete1 to 4)

		X     1 = 2
		X     2 = 2
		X     3 = 0
		X     4 = 4
		X     5 = 0
		X     6 = 1.13e+00
		X     7 = 1.46e+00
			Ymin =   6.95e+02

Case 1b: first 4 inputs integers, 3 continuous, no constraint

How to run:
- compile: cc -o simulator2 simulator2.c -lm
- psuade psuadeNomad2ouu_noconstr.in (enter M1=7)
(also make sure the psuadeNomad2ouu_noconstr.in file has discrete1 to 4)

		X     1 = 3
		X     2 = 2
		X     3 = 0
		X     4 = 5
		X     5 = 0
		X     6 = 1.13e+00
		X     7 = 1.46e+00
		X     8 = 0
			Ymin =   6.41e+02

case 2: all continuous
How to run:
- compile: cc -o simulator2 simulator2.c -lm
- psuade psuadeCobyla2ouu.in)

        Nomad takes too long. Cobyla is much better.
		X     1 =   2.35e+00
		X     2 =   1.94e+00
		X     3 =  -2.47e-24
		X     4 =   4.30e+00
		X     5 =  -1.00e-03
		X     6 =   1.05e+00
		X     7 =   1.58e+00
			Ymin =   6.84e+02

Test problem #3 : Critical function (CRIT 3)

psuade psuadeNomad3.in or psuade psuadeSCE3.in

The first 15 parameters are continuous
The next  15 parameters are discrete

How to run:
- Compile: cc -o simulator3 simulator3.c -lm
- psuade < psScriptNomad3.in

or

- psuade < psScriptSCE3.in

Solution:
	X = all 0
	Ymin =  -4.500e+04
