INFO: Creating a sample where some uncertain parameters
      are not uniformly distributed.
PDFManager INFO: some distributions are not UNIFORM.
PSUADE run: creating interface to user driver.
PSUADE run: output level = 2
PSUADE run: max parallel jobs = 1
PSUADE run: max job wait time = 1000000 seconds
PSUADE run: min job wait time = 1 seconds
PSUADE run: launch interval   = 1 seconds
PSUADE run: save frequency    = every 1000000 runs
NOTE: if evaluation should be fast but is slow, check
      save_frequency because it may be due to too much I/O.
Note: use psuade_pmachine to dynamically change max jobs.
Note: use psuade_stop to terminate gracefully.
