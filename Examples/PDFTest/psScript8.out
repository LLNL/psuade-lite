PSUADE run: creating interface to user driver.
PSUADE run: output level = 1
PSUADE run: max parallel jobs = 1
PSUADE run: max job wait time = 1000000 seconds
PSUADE run: min job wait time = 1 seconds
PSUADE run: launch interval   = 1 seconds
PSUADE run: save frequency    = every 1000000 runs
NOTE: if evaluation should be fast but is slow, check save frequency.
Note: use psuade_pmachine to dynamically change max jobs.
Note: use psuade_stop to terminate gracefully.
