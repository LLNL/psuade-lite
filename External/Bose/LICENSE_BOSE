Graphical modeling software and related items in StatLib must abide by
the following THREE items:

  (1) A short summary that gives information about the submission.
      This should be just a few (not more than two 80 char lines)
      lines which I will place in the index file.  It should concisely
      describe what your submission does.  See the current S index
      for the format and length of summaries.

  (2) The information which you would like to share.  I will take
      whatever you send me and place it in a file.  This file will
      then be available to other people.  If your submission is just
      one file then this should be fine. If you want to submit multiple
      related files then please package them in a reasonable way.
      If you can, I suggest you create a SHAR file (a Unix shell
      archive) and include a README file that describes what the
      submission does and how to use it and a manual page or S help
      page. If appropriate also include a Makefile.
      PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR NAME AND E-MAIL ADDRESS PROMINENTLY IN YOUR
      SUBMISSION AND INDICATE IF YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO
      HAVE PROBLEMS.

  (3) A statement (which should also be part of the submission) that
      explicity gives permission to redistribute the software.  You
      can retain the copyright jsut so long as you clearly state that
      the software can be freely used for non-commercial purposes and
      can be freely distributed.
      If you are not the original author of the submission please make
      sure you obtain the original author's permission before submitting
      the software.
